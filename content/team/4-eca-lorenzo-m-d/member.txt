Text: Dr. Eca is Functional Medicine practitioner and is the first HeartMath Certified Trainer in the country and teaches techniques to intelligently manage energy and stress. After completing her internal medicine training at the Philippine General Hospital, she decided to veer away from expected path of sub-specialization and instead concentrated on primary and preventive healthcare. Her lifelong interest in the complementary modalities of healing, such as mind-body medicine and energy healing, led her to pursue wellness & lifestyle medicine. Dr. Eca is a BS Psychology graduate from the University of the Philippines-Diliman and an alumna of the University of the East Ramon Magsaysay Memorial Medical Center.
