Question: What is LifeScience?

----

Answer: 

The LifeScience Center for Health and Wellness is an integrated facility committed to optimizing the health of individuals who want energetic and empowered lives, rather than lives focused on managing one health issue after another.

LifeScience Functional Medicine practitioners create programs based on your specific health goals. We can directly address your concerns with the exact type of nutrition, movement, and medically advanced treatments and testing suited to your needs.
LifeScience is the brainchild of Marv Romero-Salas, its owner and executive director. Her passion for health and international healthcare experiences inspired her to make a wide range of international medical advances available to Filipinos.
