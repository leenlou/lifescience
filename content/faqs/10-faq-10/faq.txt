Question: What is micronutrient deficiency testing?

----

Answer: 

Micronutrient deficiencies occur when the body lacks essential nutrients, like vitamins or minerals. Fatigue, weakness, hair loss, and even depression are just some of the symptoms of micronutrient deficiency. If left untreated, this can lead to serious diseases.

A micronutrient profile test will let us know what nutrients your body is missing and allows us to address deficiencies with supplements designed especially for you.
