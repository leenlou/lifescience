Question: What is Functional Medicine?

----

Answer: 

Functional Medicine is an approach that puts *you* first.

While traditional medicine is disease- centered, Functional Medicine is person-centered. LifeScience doctors consider health factors, such as the environment, lifestyle, stress, and genetic predisposition that affect a patient’s well-being. By mapping out your health history and understanding the interactions between factors affecting one’s health, your doctor gets a clear picture of the patient’s health status.

This approach also enables LifeScience doctors to identify the root cause of your health issues. It serves as a guide in developing a concrete health plan to address your existing health issues, prevent potential issues from arising, and achieving specific health goals.
