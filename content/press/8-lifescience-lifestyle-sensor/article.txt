How Filipinos are getting more attuned to their health is evident in the rise of health and wellness trends in food, diet, fitness and different regimens. With all of these being good, we still wonder why not everyone is successful in achieving good health. 

According to Dr. Zoe Arugay of LifeScience Center for Health & Wellness, one of the reasons why we miss our health goals is that we often forget to look at our well-being as a whole. Our well-being is greatly influenced by determinants of health, nutrition, sleep and relaxation, exercise and movement, stress, and environment, and how we are able to manage these factors reflects in the quality of health we get to enjoy. 

Recognizing the fact that our health is as unique as we are, LifeScience Center for Health and Wellness introduces the Lifestyle Assessment Sensor to help individuals understand how their lifestyle affects their over-all health and well-being. The program identifies the best way to manage stress, better means of recovery from exhaustion, and the right exercise for functionality.

“Stress is unavoidable. While most of us understand the impacts of stress in our health and performance, not many have been successful in managing it. Chronic stress can take a toll on one’s health affecting productivity, triggering health issues such as high blood pressure, skin problems, eating disorder, and it also affects our moods and how we are towards other people,” says Dr. Arugay. “The good news is with proper coaching from health experts, we can recover from stress through effective methods that fit your lifestyle.”

The LifeScience Lifestyle Assessment Sensor makes the link between lifestyle and well-being more visible and evident. Thus, encourage patients to be more proactive in managing their health and seek expert guidance on how to improve daily performance, and reach personal health goals.

“Because health is personal, the LifeScience Lifestyle Assessment Sensor uses and analyzes data from the patient. There is no guessing. What will go in a client’s program is based on what the patient’s body told us through the advanced medical tool, Firstbeat,” said Dr. Arugay.

The Lifestyle Sensor provides precise data on how the body is reacting to daily activities and environmental factors through heart rate variability. Our heart is continuously adjusted by autonomic nervous system to meet the demands of life resulting in variations in time between each heartbeat. Heart Rate Variability therefore, gives you and your Physician a complete picture of your health and performance. From the data, you and your Physician can work together in identifying stress triggers and how it can be managed; determine how you can better recover from the impacts of stress and improve your moments of rest and quality of sleep to regain energy and focus; and map out the right type of exercise to develop functional quality. 

“LifeScience is here to coach and guide our patients’ journey to good health. We are able to advance it through technologies that allow us see what is exactly happening in our patient’s body and use that information to help them overcome a health issue. Our only goal is to see our patients enjoy quality life,” concludes Dr. Arugay.
