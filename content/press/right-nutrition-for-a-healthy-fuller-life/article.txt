More than ever, the concept of health, fitness, and good nutrition has become increasingly in the consciousness of people today. Social media is teeming with health experts, and fitness gurus with their videos of exercises you can do anywhere, blogs and articles on healthy lifestyle and reports on the latest diets that could help you shed those extra pounds and stay healthy. But even then, most of us are still walking and living with unexplained symptoms such as rashes, migraines, body and stomach aches, and the overall vague feeling that all is not well in our bodies. And all these despite practicing “healthy living” of good diet and regular exercise. If this story sounds very close to what you are living with now, you are not alone. 

Meet Mari Jasmine — a model, TV host, and magazine writer. She is a girl who loves to live life to its fullest, but she also knows exactly what it feels like to live with chronic health conditions despite being fit and active with healthy habits. She has gone from one medical expert to another to find the cause of her bloating and bowel problems, skin problems that don’t go away, and regular migraines. However, all that she has to show for her trips to the doctors are bandaid solutions, medications to treat the symptoms, but not the cure for the cause of her health problems. 

After a lot of research, she eventually encountered Functional Medicine, where she was able to identify and address the underlying causes of her symptoms, rather than just treating the symptoms. When Mari met with one of the doctors at LifeScience Center for Health and Wellness, they sat down and discussed her entire medical history. They took a closer look at the symptoms she was experiencing, in the context of her medical history — such as a knee surgery she had in high school. Thus Mari’s journey on the path of complete health and wellness begins. 

LifeScience Center for Health and Wellness is a facility located in Bonifacio Global City that is focused on helping individuals optimize their health, through science-based approach founded in the practice of Functional Medicine. Because there is no one-size-fits-all wellness program, LifeScience designs program tailor made for the individual’s health goals. The program design takes cue from what the patient’s body is telling the Physicians, after the consultation and recommended tests results have come out. 

According to Dr. Rolando Balburias, LifeScience is the place for people who don’t want to get sick, and for patients with multiple health issues who have tried conventional medicine but have yet to feel whole and better, much like Mari Jasmine. 

The patient’s personalized program is anchored in the Center’s four (4) Core Programs, which include the Personalized Nutrition program. The program helps the patient get into the nutrition that best works for his or her lifestyle. It determines the effect of certain food on the body, which could be causing some of the common symptoms like migraine, insomnia, chronic fatigue and declining of the immune system. 

“Mari Jasmine’s nutrition program helped her address some of her health issues. More importantly, she came to understand how food, though healthy, is affecting her well-being. As unique individuals, what is good for one, is not necessarily good for another,” adds Dr. Balburias. 

One of the tests the center uses is the food intolerance test (FIT), which identifies the food items that you should be avoiding, those that you should take with caution, and those that are good for you. The FIT guides the patient in making smart choices on food so your body can maximize its nutritional benefits.

“Good health starts with what we eat, in our gut. If you are constantly experiencing symptoms like bloating, leaky gut, migraines, fatigue, high-blood pressure, skin issues and others, checking your diet is a good starting point to address them,” stressed Dr. Balburias. “Food is medicine. Eating right, choosing nutritious food helps the body heal itself, and perform at its optimum.”

The other core programs are reverse chronic disease program, weight and metabolic management and inherited disease screening and intervention. 

Presently, LifeScience is encouraging individuals to get on the road to living healthy by offering the Food Intolerance Test at P9,900.00 and P12,400.00 package rates, for a limited time.

The P9,900.00 FIT package includes results evaluation with a Nutritionist Dietitian, while the P12,400.00 FIT package includes a primary consultation with a Physician, a Body Composition Analysis (BCA), doctor’s evaluation of the FIT and BCA results, consult with a Nutritionist Dietitian, and consult with a fitness coach.
