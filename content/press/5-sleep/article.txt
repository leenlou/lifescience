November 22, 2016----Sleep is the most underestimated activity. Most of us see sleep only as a means to rest and would easily give up sleep in order to stretch our day.  In fact sleep is vital in achieving good health. 
Understanding the importance of sleep, LifeScience Center for Health and Wellness introduces its signature Sleep Analysis and Consultation. The analysis and consultation is geared towards helping individuals sleep their way to good health. 

"Most of us take sleep for granted and don't fully realize how sleep impacts our well-being," says Dr. Denise Lavilles of LifeScience Center for Health and Wellness. "Beyond getting our body to rest and regain physical strength, quality sleep supports mental and physical health, and affects quality of life. How we feel and perform throughout the day is affected by how well we slept. It is during sleep when our body is working to support vital functions of the brain and organs. Sleep also helps our cells regenerate," added Lavilles.
Sleep deprivation affects us physically and mentally. Lack of quality sleep makes us feel constantly tired, less productive, moody, react slower, making us prone to mistakes and accidents. Mentally, it affects our cognitive function, making us unable to properly focus and retain information. Our risk for chronic disease also increases with chronic sleep deprivation.

"Because of being constantly sleep deprived, having a restful sleep eventually becomes a challenge and may lead to unhealthy habits and dependency on sleeping pills. But sleep issues can be addressed." says Lavilles. 
The LifeScience Sleep Analysis and Consultation tackles sleep issues through a multi-disciplinary, scientific and proactive approach. “It is vital to recognize the basic underlying factors affecting and causing sleep problems, in order to determine the appropriate steps needed to sleep better. We cannot simply just keep treating the symptoms. Sleeping pills, for example, may help for a brief period of time and under a doctor’s supervision. However, insomnia cannot be cured with sleeping pills alone. They can actually make insomnia worse in the long run. Sleep is such a dynamic and relational process – it has to be understood in relation to everything else.”

"As unique individuals, sleep issues can be caused by so many things, such as occupational and lifestyle factors, as well as physiologic and biologic alterations, like hormone changes and nutrient deficiencies. Because of the varying influences and types of sleep disorders, a personalized and comprehensive approach is key in addressing sleep issues down to root cause," stressed Lavilles.

The first step is to find out more about the individual during and beyond his sleep through traditional and advanced methods such as comprehensive history taking, actigraphy, heart rate variability, 24-hour salivary cortisol/melatonin, nutrient and metabolic profiling. Once this information is available, your Physician will map-out a treatment plan that lets you fully understand what issues affect your sleep. A more thorough understanding of how your body works empowers you to be more involved in getting your restful sleep back.
