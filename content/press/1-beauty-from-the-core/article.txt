 When people talk of beauty, certain things come to mind - makeup or designer outfits or skincare line - limiting the concept of beauty to something superficial. Beauty icon Audrey Hepburn, however, disagreed when she said that the beauty of a woman is not in the clothes she wears, the figure that she carries, or the way she combs her hair. True enough, many will agree that real beauty comes from somewhere deeper than skin. LifeScience believes in exactly that. 

**Achieving Optimum Health**
The LifeScience Center for Health and Wellness believes in beauty that emanates from a cellular level. Their philosophy is based on the premise that as people age, cells degenerate causing symptoms of waging and fatigue to manifest. By going deeper to understand these biological units, LifeScience is able to provide personalised treatments achieved through the use of the best medical practices and the most advanced equipment in the world. 

LifeScience does this through its systematic preventive wellness regimen, which utilises three important steps. It begins with a thorough consultation wherein clients get one and a half hours of consultation with an expert Anti-aging physician to discuss health goals and understand their current health state. It is followed by a series of tests that shows an individual’s unique health qualities. From there, customised treatments are prescribed. “We don’t just vie you [any] program,” explains Executive Director Maria Victoria “Marv” Romero-Salas. “It’s really customized to what your body needs.”

**Beauty in Health**
Through each personalised treatment, LifeScience is able to provide a tailor fit solution to an individual’s needs, reaping far superior results than regular treatments. LifeScience is the only wellness center in the country that offers customised anti-aging and preventive medicine as it believes in working from within to achieve beauty all throughout. 

Aging, from a cellular point, begins when less oxygen is absorbed by the bloodstream. This results in dry skin, poor circulation, and even chronic fatigue. The revolutionary Hyperbaric Oxygen Treatment (HBOT), “delivers 100% oxygen to your cells, nourishing the blood, giving you that youthful effect.” 

LifeScience recognizes that everyone is biologically unique. Hence, a person’s nutritional needs differ from another. That is why LifeScience provides Customized Nutraceuticals. Unlike ordinary supplements that you can buy over-the-counter, the Customized Nutraceuticals line is the perfect mix of nutrients to help your body achieve its optimum level of health. 

Finally, exercise is still the most no-nonsense regiment to ensure graceful aging, and Kinesis is LifeScience’s way of making this easy. This specialised workout system, which zeroes in on commonly injured areas to strengthen joints and ligaments, also assists in improving muscular strength, endurance, and flexibility.
