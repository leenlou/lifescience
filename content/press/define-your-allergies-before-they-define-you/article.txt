Allergies manifest themselves in many ways and in varying degrees. Beyond the inconvenience of rashes and sneezes, some allergy manifestations can be as bad as swollen lips, shortness of breath, vomiting, or at its worst, it can cause a medical emergency like an anaphylactic shock. The symptoms depends on what you’re allergic to and how you came in contact with it. Most of the time, you find out that you’re allergic to something when it has already caused a reaction in your body, and not before so you can avoid it. 

With FABER, the screening test for allergies, you can identify your allergens before they can cause an allergic reaction. FABER is the most up-to-date and complete tool today to diagnose an allergy. Made with the most advanced knowledge in the field of nanotechnology, FABER was created to measure specific antibodies against bacteria, viruses and allergens; and uses molecular allergens and allergen extracts using only minimal blood samples from the patient. 

The FABER test evaluates allergenic molecules and extracts from over a hundred possible allergenic sources such as: mites and other insects; pollen from various weeds, grass, and trees; animal hair (dogs, cats, horses, rats); molds and yeasts; various types of food; insect venoms; and latex. 

There are many reasons to take the FABER test. It is recommended to take the FABER test if you have allergy with rhinitis, conjunctivitis, asthma, urticaria, eczema, food reactions including abdominal pain and diarrhea, or insect or latex-induced reactions — and if there are other members of your family who suffer from these allergies. Also when more than one symptom appear at the same time and are have several triggers. Find out what is causing your reactions so you and your doctor can take a more pro-active and specific approach to your allergies. Take the test also if you have done the restriction diets but without success, and avoiding the things you are allergic to but without success. The test is also a good preparation for moving or traveling to a new foreign locale, or starting a new job. It is also used to perform a periodical screening test for early diagnosis, or simply for an allergy vaccine.

Anybody is eligible to take the FABER test — from infants to the elderly. There is no need to fast or to stop therapies, even for allergies. It only takes a small amount of blood to perform the test, and unlike skin tests, even patients with severe dermatitis such as urticaria or eczema can have it done. 

You may request for the FABER test from your medical practitioner. Global Medical Technologies Manila is the Philippine partner of FABER.
