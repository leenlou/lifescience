Functional Movement Screening (FMS) is a rating and ranking system that captures basic movement patterns and motor control, and measures your movement patterns. It was designed to make you aware of your movement at the start of any exercise program. This screening tool emphasizes the quality rather than the quantity of your movements.

FMS uses seven exercises to document patterns important to normal function. This helps us identify inefficient movements that might cause injuries or reduce your performance and physical condition, and distort body awareness.

FMS addresses movement patterns as a whole and is used when determining the right exercise program for you. With FMS, a Functional Movement Screen Score is generated. This score helps your fitness coach accurately target problems and track progress. This scoring system is linked to the most beneficial corrective exercises that bring you back to sound movement patterns.

An FMS Session is a one-on-one session with a LifeScience Kinesiologist and takes around 30 minutes.
