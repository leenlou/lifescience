Working with a nutrition coach helps you get into the right diet and develop the right eating habits that work for you and your lifestyle. This will help you achieve a certain health goal, address certain health issues, and prevent potential ones.

We offer four different types of Nutrition Plans:

**The Weight Management and Maintenance Nutrition Plan**  is for clients who wish to lose, gain or maintain weight or muscle mass. Aside from losing, gaining, or maintaining weight, you will understand how different types of food contribute to your weight.

**The Therapeutic Nutrition Plan** is for clients experiencing metabolic diseases such as diabetes, and other similar health concerns. This plan is perfect for clients who aim to address their illness and possibly reverse its symptoms through diet.

**The Sports Nutrition Plan** is suitable for sportspersons, whether competitive athletes or weekend warriors. Our Sports Nutrition Plan is geared towards optimizing athletic performance. This plan has many variations as it is based on several factors, such as the athleteâ€™s training regimen and competition season.

Each nutrition plan contains the following:

What You Get:

* Calorie computed nutrition plan good for one month which details specific portions, servings, food groups, and food recommendations
* 1 week sample menu

Components:

* Nutrition assessment
* Body Composition Analysis and Anthropometric Measurements
* Dietary Evaluation (based on food diary)
* Customized Nutrition Plan
* Mid Plan Evaluation and Modification

Changes to your initial plan may be recommended after a Nutrition Follow-Up Consultation, where your Nutritionist-Dietitian will assess your progress.
