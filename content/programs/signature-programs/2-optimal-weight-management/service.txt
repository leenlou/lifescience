## Optimal Weight Management for Men and Women

The program moves away from the one-size-fits all approach to weight loss and reviews factors such as sleep, stress, and your environment. It determines the effects of all these factors on your ability to gain or lose weight. The program is ideal for those suffering from obesity or undergoing menopause, andropause, and thyropause — an underactive thyroid condition.
