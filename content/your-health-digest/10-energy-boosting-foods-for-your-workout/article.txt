Many people rely on energy supplements, such as energy drinks, right before working out. These kinds of drinks give a sudden jolt of energy that gets most people running or motivated. But there are other, more natural sources of energy that you can turn to before your workouts.

Instead of reaching for those energy supplements, you can get the energy boost you need for your workout in the food you eat before and after. These are foods that with the right amount of nutrients which can  give you an energy boost and contribute to a balanced diet. Here are some foods that you can consider instead:

**Milk**
Milk isn’t just for growing kids. It’s actually a good source of protein and carbohydrates that can give you the energy you need while also being good for building muscles. Drinking milk is good for your pre and post workout regimen. Food and drinks that are high in both protein and carbohydrates should be consumed at least three hours before you head to the gym. Forty-five minutes to an hour after your workout, drink some milk again or consume another food item high in both protein and carbohydrates for your post-workout.

**Coconut Oil**
Coconut oil is high in Medium Chain Triglyceride or MCTS, a unique form of dietary fat that is turned into energy quickly and efficiently. Fat can also be a good source of energy in controlled amounts. There’s no need to avoid fat completely because more than being a source of energy, our body also need it for insulation, cushioning for internal organs, the production of hormones and more — but again, in controlled amounts.

**Maca Powder**
Maca is a plant found in Peru. It is used as a nutritional supplement in powder form and has many health benefits, one of which is boosting energy. Professional athletes often use Maca powder for peak performance because it also increases their stamina and endurance.

**Asparagus**
Asparagus is rich in B vitamins which are very important in turning food into energy. Although the body only needs a small amount of each kind of B vitamin, a deficiency in one kind of vitamin can affect your body’s ability to turn food into energy.
