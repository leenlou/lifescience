It’s common knowledge that junk food is bad for the body but, for some people, it’s hard to let go. These types of food are very high in calories but have very low nutritional content. They come in all shapes, sizes, and packaging, and are appealing to the taste buds, but they contribute very little to the body’s needs. When you see commercials on television or when you pass by ads, it’s harder to let go of these since they’re everywhere. However, there’s more to these junk foods that are detrimental, and to simply say that they’re unhealthy and should be eaten in moderation is not enough.

**1. Avoid sodas.**
These drinks contain ingredients that, when consumed on a regular basis, will negatively affect the body. An example of this is dissolved carbon dioxide which becomes gas when it warms to body temperature. When you consume too much carbonated drinks, carbon dioxide builds up in the stomach and can cause belching. This makes some food and stomach acid go up the food pipe, causing heartburn and leaving a sour taste in your mouth. Another ingredient found in sodas and other junk food that you should watch out for is sugar.

**2. Cut down on sugar.**
At certain levels, sugar can be good. However, there is too much sugar in junk food. When your body absorbs  sugar, your brain gives off serotonin and dopamine and this tricks you into thinking that the junk food is making you feel better. The junk food also affects your energy levels.

High levels of sugar will make you feel hyper and energized. However, because junk food doesn’t have enough good carbohydrates and protein, your energy level will suddenly drop after eating, making you feel irritable and fatigued, and craving even more sugar. Your metabolism is affected too. When you eat junk food with too much refined sugar, your body will have to produce more insulin to avoid dangerous spikes in your blood sugar levels. Other than sugar, other ingredients found in most junk foods are fat and sodium.

**3. Try not to eat fast food.**
Most fast food products are high in fat and sodium. Fast food may be convenient and affordable, however, too much of it isn’t healthy. Consuming too much fat and sodium can raise your blood cholesterol levels and can also lead to arterial plaque build-up, making it harder for blood to pass through your arteries. Obesity is another consequence to watch out for with a high intake of fat. Too much fat in big proportions with not enough exercise can result in obesity.

Carbonated drinks, high levels of sugar, fat, and sodium partnered with low nutritional values are just some reasons why you should avoid junk food as much as possible. Avoiding junk food may be hard but the health benefits are more than you’d expect.
