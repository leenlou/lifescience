As the temperature rise, exercising in the heat might make shaping up less fun.

Here are some great workout hacks to keep you healthy, sexy and comfortable:

1.	Sunscreen
Protect your skin by going for a SPF50 sunscreen. The tropical sun can be intense so make sure you don’t get burned when outside.

2.	Hydrate
Always carry a bottle of water. Drink every 15 minutes even if you’re not thirsty. Double up when you break a sweat to cool down your body.

3.	Listen to your Body
Know when to push yourself and know when to rest. Split up your workouts or shorten them if needed.

4.	Slow Down
Move with less intensity or do intervals to avoid overheating during these hot spells.

5.	Adjust your Body Temperature
Jump in the shower before a work out as a pre-exercise cool down.

6.	Eat more Fruits
Fruits are 80% water, so refuel your body by snacking on grapes, watermelon or cantaloupe. These fruits boost your energy post-workout.
