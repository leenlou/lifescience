Dr. Denise specializes in Internal Medicine, focusing on health promotion and disease prevention for adults. She earned her bachelor’s degree in Molecular Biology and Biotechnology from the University of the Philippines - Diliman and her Medical Degree from the University of the East Ramon Magsaysay Memorial Medical Center. With more than 11 years of medical experience, a background in Functional Medicine (FM) and Molecular Medicine, Dr. Denise is our Featured Doctor for this issue.

When asked about what attracted her to functional medicine, Dr. Denise happily answered: “Definitely a lot.” However, she did highlight two things. She explained how the practice is about client empowerment. Dr. Denise believes that, more than addressing the client’s health concern, it’s  important for the client to understand what was happening in his or her body. When patients know more about what was happening, “they [clients] are more active in managing their health,” said Dr. Denise.

Other than functional medicine’s preventive approach, Dr. Denise also believes in how clients can still manage and improve their health in more ways than just taking medication for their illness or disease. She explained that “it is important that they realize that there are still things they can do to sort of manage their conditions.”

When asked what was the one thing about functional medicine that she wanted people to know more about, Dr. Denise answered, “Functional medicine is for everyone.” She explained that since functional medicine emphasizes the determinants of health, such as nutrition, exercise, sleep and stress management (to name a few), it is more of a change in perspective, mindset and lifestyle. All of these can apply to anyone, both men and women, young and old.
