Getting a good night’s sleep can make us feel ready to take on the world every day we are awake.

Research shows that our sleeping habits affect our physical health and emotional well-being – making thoughts clearer and emotions more balanced. Depriving ourselves of sleep may lead to medical conditions like obesity, diabetes, heart disease and even early mortality.

To inspire you to get more proper zzz’s this new year, we present to you 5 benefits of sleep:

**Body repair.**
During your restful hours, your body releases protein molecules that help boost your immune system. Sleep is the time your body heals and repairs itself!

**Stress reduction.**
Life can move fast, and sleep slows us down and relaxes us. It lowers our blood pressure and stress hormones level!

**Better focus.**
When we sleep, the brain rests too. It allows us to process new experiences and knowledge better, increasing understanding and retention for our everyday.

**Balance your mood.**
We can get cranky when we are sleep deprived. What we forget is how sleep balances our emotions, making days more joyous.

**Healthy and happier life.**
Sleep is a normal, daily function for people, but it is also something we need to value and take joy in doing. Getting quality rest makes our bodies healthier, thus happier!

We hope that as you spend time under the covers tonight, you remember the many good things that come out from it. Happy sleeping!
