Our diets are causing more and more illnesses in today’s time. We’ve moved from plant-based diets to high-fat, animal-based diets, whilst becoming physically inactive. Our bodies are having a harder time processing the food we are eating, and are causing our species to be more overweight than ever.

Here are some illnesses connected to obesity, which can increase the risk of heart diseases:

**Coronary Heart Disease:**
This is a condition in which a fatty substance called “plaque” builds up inside the coronary arteries that supply oxygen-rich blood to the heart. Once the plaque blocks the blood, it can cause angina or even heart failure.

**High Blood Pressure:**
Blood pressure is the force of blood flowing through arteries as the heart pumps blood. Having high blood pressure can damage the body and the heart in many ways.

**Abnormal Blood Fats**
Obesity can raise blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels. It also lower “good” HDL cholesterol, a cholesterol linked with lower heart disease and stroke risk.

**Type 2 Diabetes:**
Diabetes is a condition where your blood’s glucose is too high. Obesity can induce diabetes, where the dangers of heart attack is especially high for these people.
