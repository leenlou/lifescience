Nutrigenomics is a multidisciplinary science that studies how food affects our genes. According to Dr. Mark Hyman, pioneer of functional medicine, nutrigenomics is the science of how food is also a source of information about what your body receives. The food that you consume signals your body which genes to turn on or off.

This science looks into how genetic differences can affect how a person responds to nutrients in the food that we eat. In other words, this branch of science shows the relationship between nutrition and genetic modifications. The science of Nutrigenomics is based on five tenets:

1. Diet can be a serious factor for a number of diseases under certain circumstances and depending on the individuals.
2. Common chemicals in food can have serious effects on the human genome, either directly or indirectly, to alter gene expression or structure, thus changing its purpose or effect.
3. The degree to which diet influences the balance between healthy and diseased states may depend on an individual's genetic makeup.
4. Some diet regulated genes are likely to play a role in the onset, incidence, progression, and/or severity of chronic diseases.
5. Dietary intervention based on knowledge of nutritional requirement, nutritional status, and genotype (i.e., "personalized nutrition") can be used to prevent, mitigate or cure chronic disease.

Studies have shown that using Nutrigenomics, chronic disease and certain cancers can be prevented, mitigated or treated. These are all possible by modifying or altering certain genes through the power of nutrition. The first step to all of this is gene testing, as it gives the necessary information on how the client should live. Afterwards, it is important to be proactive and start to make the necessary nutrition changes to see the desired results.

Prevention is better than cure, and nutrigenomics is a way to prevent future diseases. It's a big advancement in the field of health care and is definitely worth looking into.
