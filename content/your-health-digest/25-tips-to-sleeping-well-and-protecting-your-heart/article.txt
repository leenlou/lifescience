There are many reasons why you should get a good night’s sleep, and caring for your heart may not be on the top of your mind.

But what if it should be?

As we get used to having busier lives in this modern world, we get less and less sleep, which hurts more than our energy levels – it also harms our hearts. Adults need 7-9 hours of quality sleep to keep feeling good in life. When we sleep, our heart rate and blood pressure lower down, and that may be key to getting our hearts healthy.

Here are some tips to get you to sleep well and care for your heart better:

1.	Learn about your sleep problems.
Are you tired after a long night’s sleep? Do you feel sleepy at work? Do you snore? Do you wake up at night and take long to fall back into sleep again? Talk to a sleep specialist to evaluate and observe your sleeping habits.

2.	Have a bedtime routine.
Program your body to go to bed and wake up at a particular time. Changing into sleeping clothes is a good way to train your brain to fall asleep.

3.	Shut down.
Electronics are a big sleep-stealer. Scrolling through your phone and watching TV can take away precious moments of a good night’s sleep.

4.	Avoid caffeine.
It takes 6 hours or longer for your body to get rid of caffeine. Keep that in mind before taking that shot of espresso in the afternoon.

5.	Sleep and Heart Health are Connected so Prevention is Key.
Your heart health impacts your sleep, and vice versa. If you’re being treated for your heart issues, chances are, you may experience worse sleeping patterns. The key to better sleep and better heart health is prevention, prevention, prevention.
