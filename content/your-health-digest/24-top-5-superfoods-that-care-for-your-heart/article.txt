Heart disease maybe one of the top causes of deaths in today’s time, but the good news is that we now know a lot more about how to prevent it.

80% of heart disease can be prevented through healthy diets and lifestyle choices. It’s time to start cleaning up your nutrition plan and staying away from salty and processed foods, and moving towards more fresh eats that are actually good for the heart:

1.	Avocado
This trendy superfood is both very hip and super healthy. It is packed with monounsaturated fatty acids, which help lower cholesterol levels and may help prevent blood clotting. It also contains potassium, which may help control blood pressure.

2.	Salmon
Fatty fish is a great heart-healthy addition for your daily meals. It contains copious amounts of omega-3 fatty acids that are said to lower the risk of arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat) and atherosclerosis (plaque build-up in the arteries) and decrease triglycerides. Tuna, sardines and mackerel are also known to be great sources of Omega-3.

3.	Nuts
These little things have a huge effect on our cardiovascular system. They contain unsaturated fats that improve cholesterol by lowering the bad and increasing the good kind of cholesterol. They contain Omega-3 fatty acids (see number 2!) and amino acids that ease the blood flow. Snacking on your favorite nuts can be very nutritious for your heart!

4.	Dark Chocolate
This indulgence is actually really good for you. Cacao, the plant which chocolate is made, is rich in flavornols, which help lower blood pressure and prevent blood clots. It also has antioxidants that keep bad cholesterol from sticking to your artery wall. Don’t forget to get the ones with 70% dark chocolate and less sugar!

5.	Red Wine
Pour up some vino in moderation, and you’ve got polyphenol that increase good cholesterol. It also contains antioxidants from the grapes which improve blood flow to the brain, possibly preventing strokes.

We hope that these easy superfoods can help you be more aware and take even better care of your heart.
