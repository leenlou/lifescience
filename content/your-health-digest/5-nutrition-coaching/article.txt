At LifeScience, we offer nutrition coaching that helps clients attain their health goals through a personalized and customized diet. We have four Nutritional Plans that cater to many of our clients’ needs.

Through nutrition coaching, the LifeScience Nutritionist-Dietitian will be able to devise diet plans that are prepared according to your health concerns. More than devising the diet, they will also be able to explain how your diet contributes to your concern or desired result. In doing so, you will not only be better guided with your food choices but also you will begin to understand how the food you eat affects your body.

We offer four different types of Nutrition Plans:

**The Weight Management and Maintenance Nutrition Plan** is aimed towards clients who wish to lose, gain or maintain weight or muscle mass, but the result of these plans are more than just losing, gaining, or maintaining weight; clients increase their understanding of how different types of food contribute to their weight.

**The Therapeutic Nutrition Plan**is catered to clients experiencing metabolic diseases, such as diabetes, and other similar health concerns. This nutrition plan is perfect for clients who aim to address their illness, and possibly reverse its symptoms through diet.

**The Sports Nutrition Plan** is suitable for athletes, whether competitive athletes or weekend warriors. Our Sports Nutrition Plan is geared towards optimizing the client’s athletic performance. This plan has many variations as it is based on several factors, such as the athlete’s training regimen and competition season.

The following are what’s included in every nutrition plan:

What You Get:

- Calorie computed nutrition plan good for one month which details specific portions, servings, food groups, and food recommendations
- 1 week sample menu

Components:
- Nutrition assessment
- Body Composition Analysis and Anthropometric Measurements
- Dietary Evaluation (based on food diary)

Modification to the initial plan may be recommended after a Nutrition Follow-Up Consultation, wherein your Nutritionist-Dietitian will assess your progress.
