Food is a biological need for all living things. It is the source of all the energy we need and use to maintain our normal bodily functions. That’s why what we regularly consume says a lot about our body. The contents of the food we eat is a reflection of what our body absorbs, and how our body functions is physical proof to how food was absorbed.

When we don’t have a regular balanced diet, our body doesn’t function properly. A way to reverse this is to do the opposite. If the wrong food choices cause illness, making the proper or healthier food choices can resolve or alleviate illness. In LifeScience, we have a program to help you with just that.
The Core Nutrition Program is one of our signature programs. It is a 3-month program that measures certain effects of food on your body and maximizes the impact of food and supplements. By doing so, it aims to boost your energy and address symptoms of malnourishment, such as hair loss, chronic fatigue, and a declining immune system, as well as lessen food intolerance symptoms such as migraines and insomnia.

If you wish to avail of the Core Nutrition Program or have questions about food, schedule a Nutrition Consultation today with a quick call to 828-LIFE or an e-mail to web@lifescience.ph.
