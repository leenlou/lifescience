People know that cigarette smoking increases the risk of lung cancer and respiratory problems, but fail to realize that it is also a major cause of cardiovascular disease, which includes coronary heart disease and stroke.

Research shows that smoking increases one’s heart rate, tightens major arteries, and can cause an irregular heart rhythm, all of which makes your heart work harder than it already does. 

Here are some of the effects of smoking to your circulatory system, and just a few from the long list of reason, why you should quit today:

1.	It reduces how much oxygen your heart gets. 
2.	It raises your blood pressure.
3.	Speeds up your heart rate. 
4.	Make blood clots.
5.	Harm the insides of your blood vessels.
6.	Replaces oxygen with carbon monoxide.
7.	Increase the risk of a heart attack by 2-6 times.
8.	Risk of coronary heart disease for women taking contraceptive pills.
9.	Stroke is increased 3 times.
10.	Nicotine triggers palpitations.

We hope that this list helps enlighten you of the real effects of smoking to your heart, and help you start your journey to stopping, today.
