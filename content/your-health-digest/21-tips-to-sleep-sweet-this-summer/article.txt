Hot or warm nights are made bearable only by air conditioners.

But what if you’re an environmentally responsible citizen who wants to practice some conscious alternatives?

Read these select tips to help you have sweet dreams:

1.	Use cotton sheets and clothes.
Breathable fabric makes for less sticky nights, as it allows proper ventilation and airflow in your bedroom.

2.	Drink lots of water.
Staying hydrated is a must especially on hot days. You may want to have a glass of water ready by your bedside.

3.	Eat greens for dinner.
You might want to rethink your high protein meal before sleeping because your body generates metabolic heat. Switching to salads and fruits is a good option so that your body can metabolizefood with less effort.

4.	Don’t exercise before bedtime.
Your body temperature rises when you exercise. Give your body ample time to cool down before sleeping.

5.	Take a tepid shower.
A cold shower might raise your body temperature to counteract the cold. A medium cold bath is best on sweaty nights.

6.	Mist your face with a spray bottle.
Waking up on hot nights happen. Be ready with this little sleep trick to cool down.
