----

Text: 

Any activity is good for your heart, but there are some activities that improve your cardiovascular fitness even better and one of these activities is swimming.

Swimming is a great way to get yourself in shape, which means a heart that has to work less during everyday life.

Here are some things to consider on why you should take the plunge:

1. **Cardiovascular Conditioning** - Swimming is a great cardio workout that improves the body’s use of oxygen, without overworking the heart. This is reflected in the decline of your resting heart rate and respiratory rate along. This improves your blood flow and reduces chronic illnesses.

2. **Stress Reduction** - Just being in the water can be very relaxing. It is meditative, as your mind is soothed by the calm of the water, making you focus on breath and movement. This stress-busting aspect could contribute to the cardiovascular benefits of swimming, and even further encourage a positive attitude.

3. **Lower Blood Pressure** - Lowering your stress means lower blood pressure. This then lowers the risk for heart disease or stroke.Swimming is a great exercise that can lower the blood pressure of adults because it is easy on the joints, and it’s not likely to cause overheating.

So, are you ready to take the plunge?
