As functional medicine practitioners, we believe that, aside from using food as medicine, exercise can be one of the best ways to reverse the negative effects of disease or illness in your body. This means not only encouraging you towards exercising in general, but also helping you find a regimen that you can stick to. We also recommend personalized exercise prescriptions to each client.

We understand that starting out and sticking to your workout commitments can get challenging and oftentimes, the main culprit for falling out of a routine is boredom or loss of interest. Check out some tips below that can help you stick to your fitness goals.

**1. Get a workout buddy.**
You don’t have to go through it alone. Everyone knows that doing things with someone else often makes the challenge easier. It’ll also help you spend more positive quality time  (remember: endorphins!) together with your friend, partner, or family member. Choosing the right workout buddy will also motivate you to do better and help you push harder to reach your goals.

**2. Join a new class.**
With all the interesting new fitness spots in the metro, joining a class you haven’t tried before will definitely change things up. Why not try a kinesis session here at LifeScience, or a spinning class, or finally doing that yoga class you’ve always put off. There are some great promos and freebies out there for first timers that can help you find out what really works for you.

**3. Music. Music. Music.**
The power of music to get people in the right mood and get people going is almost miraculous. Spend some time crafting that perfect playlist that will keep you moving and in a great mood before, during, and after your workout.

**4. Set your goals, track your progress, and reward yourself.**
It’s never a good idea to start out blindly. Sit yourself down first and really figure out what it is you’re trying to achieve with all these workouts. Then, set goals and milestones for yourself and define points where you can give yourself tiny rewards that keep you motivated and on track. Try out one of the many fitness apps out there and find the one that best fits with your goals and style.

**5. Don’t be afraid to ask for help.**
Putting together a new workout regimen or trying something new can be a challenging experience, especially when you’re starting out. When trying to achieve your fitness goal, accept that it is okay to ask for help. Won’t it be better if you started off on the right foot from the get go? LifeScience can help you out here.
