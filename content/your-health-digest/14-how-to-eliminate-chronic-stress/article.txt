These days, stress is almost as unavoidable as breathing. From the moment you wake up, to hours spent at work, to sitting in traffic on the way home, there are so many things that make your blood pressure rise and increase those stress levels. Since stressful situations are basically inevitable, managing stress makes all the difference.

In the practice of functional medicine, findings show that stress directly affects the body’s immune system. The more stressed you are, the more susceptible you become to getting sick. In cases of chronic stress, diseases like heart disease, asthma, obesity, depression and anxiety increase, among others. Here are some tips on how to start eliminating chronic stress from your life and making sure you stay far away from these potential problems.

**1. Start by eating right.**
Eating right can greatly affect your cortisol, also known as your stress hormone, levels. Cortisol  is released when your body responds to stress and low blood sugar. Eating right and on time helps restore the balance of insulin and cortisol in your body along with other hormones. Try to avoid caffeine, alcohol, and refined sugars. Instead, go for real, whole foods such as clean protein, healthy fats, and leafy veggies.

**2. Look beyond the surface.**
Sometimes stress levels are biological, with mercury toxicity, magnesium and vitamin B12 deficiencies, and gluten allergies often being the culprit. Inquire with your doctor for a Micronutrient Deficiency Test in order to address these deficiencies.

**3. Get enough sleep.**
Lack of sleep has been shown to directly affect your stress levels. Read up on our article, 5 Easy Hacks to Getting Enough Sleep, if you aren’t getting any quality shut-eye.

**4. Prioritize your work-life balance.**
The concept of work-life balance is no secret, yet many of us still struggle to achieve it. A rewarding personal life can greatly help in managing stressful situations, especially when it comes with a strong support system. It’s time to really commit to having a work-life balance and really set limits in order for you to enjoy the life you’ve worked so hard for.

**5. Breathe.**
Taking deep, slow, full breaths have been shown to care for your vagus nerve and resets your body’s stress response. The vagus nerve, or relaxation nerve, runs through your diaphragm and is reactivated with every deep breath you take. In very stressful situations, take three to five deep breaths before you proceed.
