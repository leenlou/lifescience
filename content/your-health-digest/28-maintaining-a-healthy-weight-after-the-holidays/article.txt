The holidays are over but the excess fat has come to stay.

Get healthy and get moving with these 5 simple steps to maintain a healthy weight after the Christmas season:

**Set a goal and plan it.**
A goal without a plan is just a wish. How many pounds do you want to lose? What do you have to do to get there? Are there changes you can apply to your life right now? Make them concrete and write them down!

**Find a great workout.**
Shed the pounds by committing to more physical activities that get your heart pumping, your blood rushing and your facesmiling. Find a workout that you enjoy doing so you can commit to it better and longer.

**Stay away from the screen.**
We spend too much time sitting down and looking at screens. Go for a walk, breathe in fresh air, cook a healthy meal and enjoy life by being in the moment.

**Eat balanced meals and drink lots of water.**
Did you indulge yourself last Christmas and now regret it? Now is the time to learn from that experience and make better decisions on what you put in your body.

**Include fruits and vegetables in your diet.**
Natureâ€™s super foods are the best way to stop overeating. Fruits and veggies have vitamins, minerals and are packed with fiber that fills you up.
