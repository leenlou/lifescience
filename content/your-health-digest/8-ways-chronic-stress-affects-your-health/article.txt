We have been accustomed to experiencing stress daily, but what we don’t know is the grave effect it has on our lives.

Chronic stress, whether from small daily frustrations like traffic jams or bigger worries in one’s personal life and workplace, can be detrimental to our health over time. Chronic stress can:

**Weaken your Immune System.**
Don’t be surprised about getting a cold when you’re always under stress. Our immune system becomes less sensitive to cortisol, a stress hormone that dampens our ability to fight infections and stop diseases.

**Make you gain weight.**
Apart from food cravings, stress eating, and a lack of energy to work out, our bodies store fat longer when we are experiencing prolonged stress.

**Cause sleep disorders.**
Worrying before bed can keep us up at night. These worries can be compounded into insomnia and our inability to get enough rest for our bodies.

**Cause muscle pains and headaches.**
Stress can cause our muscles to contract involuntarily and cause tension headaches and muscle pains all over the body.

**Decrease your overall quality of  life.**
Anxiety and depression are some of the negative results of our inability to manage our stress well. It affects us emotionally, mentally and physically, which disallows us to live a fuller life.
