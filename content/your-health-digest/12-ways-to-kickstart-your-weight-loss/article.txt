As functional medicine practitioners, we truly believe in the power of exercise as medicine especially when it comes to reversing the effects of illness and disease on your body. This means we also recommend personalized exercise prescriptions to each client. But getting that regimen started sometimes takes more effort than keeping it going, especially for those coming from a lifestyle totally without exercise.

Here are some simple tips to help you get started on your weight loss regimen without breaking your back or the bank.

**1. Drink more water.** 
Many don’t notice it, but the day often goes by with people not consuming enough fluids. Try to keep a water bottle with you at all times to keep you hydrated. Water has no calories and can help make you feel full. Try to aim for at least 2-3 glasses of water per meal and at least 2 in between to get in at least 8 glasses every day.

**2. Get enough sleep.**
We can’t stress enough how important it is to get enough sleep. Not getting enough sleep can greatly affect your appetite and how mindful you are about what you eat. If you’re having any problems with  sleeping, read  our article about some simple hacks to getting enough sleep.

**3. Avoid sitting for hours on end.**
We’re all guilty of sitting for extended periods of time, whether in the car, at work, or at home. Try to take breaks, stand up once every hour, and walk around for at least five minutes to get your blood flowing again. If you can, try to stand up while working or schedule leisure activities or meetings that involve movement and walking around.

**4. Eat better and build a healthy relationship with food.**
Honestly, it could be as simple as committing to eating breakfast every day. It could be eating a balanced meal at every mealtime and actually having meals on time. It’s all about creating a healthier relationship with food that will help you make better, healthier nutrition decisions.

**5. Identify your motivation and create achievable goals.**
The best way to kickstart your weight loss journey and keep at it is to really think about why you’re doing it and what drives you. By establishing your goals and understanding what motivates you, you’ll be able to set milestones, identify when to reward yourself, and also determine a realistic and achievable end goal.
