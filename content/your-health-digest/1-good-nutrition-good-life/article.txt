An improved quality of life is one of the most significant results when you practice good nutrition. You will have enough energy and time to do everything you want to do, whether exploring the world or seeing all of your children graduate college. In other words, good nutrition doesn’t just affect your body and the way you feel, it also contributes to a longer and better quality of life.

Food is one of the two factors that make good nutrition. To be specific, an adequate and balanced diet partnered with regular physical activity is what makes good nutrition. We’ve listed below some specific effects of good nutrition and how it assures you a better quality of life.

**Good Nutrition...**

**1. Helps you maintain or attain the appropriate weight for your height.**
Nowadays, obesity is one of the most common health problems. Obesity is the result of an imbalanced diet dominated by junk food. With good nutrition, it could easily be avoided.

**2. Contributes to mental well being.**
Good nutrition doesn’t only directly affect our body; it also affects our mind. When we invest in practicing good nutrition, we have good hormonal balance, which affects our mood, energy and other bodily functions.

**3. Improves your capacity to learn and concentrate.**
Learning is a constant process in life, and accomplishing tasks will be a breeze if you can concentrate better. When you consume the right amount of vitamins and minerals with a balanced diet of fruits, vegetables and good meat, learning can be as easy as pie.

**4. Sustains your energy level.**
Energy is the drive that we need to accomplish our goals. With the many demands in our lives, such as school and work, sustaining our energy level is very important. The caffeine in energy drinks and coffee may give you a boost of energy, but three balanced meals a day can also sustain the energy you will need.

**5. Strengthens your bones and muscles.**
Unexpected accidents, such a tripping or missing a step, can result in very little injury if you have strong bones and muscles. When you consume the correct amount of nutrients, such as calcium, you’ll worry less about getting injured.

**6. Strengthens your immune system.**
A strong immune system will fight off most, if not all, diseases, similar to a fort or a barricade. Good nutrition will strengthen or improve your immune system barricade and provides everything it needs to ward off intruders and repair the damages it sustains when fighting off unwanted diseases.

The above list may have mentioned only six effects of good nutrition, but these effects on your body will do more than what’s listed and will assure you of a better life. Remember, one factor of a  quality life is good nutrition, which is the combination of an adequate and balanced diet  and regular physical activity.
