Text: I’m so happy I finally broke my 112 lbs weight barrier! I needed to drop weight for my half Ironman and now I’m down to 111 lbs. I’m so inspired to keep training and my trainer even says I look less bloated. Thank you for being the reason for this awesome lifestyle change! A better understanding of my body was what I needed to progress.
