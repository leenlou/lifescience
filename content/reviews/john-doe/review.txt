Text: Since starting the Elite Athletes Program, I've really learned a lot about my body. It was very interesting to find out my genes show that I'm more of a power athlete. However, I learned  from my Functional Medicine Consult that, despite this, my body can be adapted for endurance sports, through proper training and nutrition.
